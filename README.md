# Analysis of Two-Stage Assessments in General Chemistry at UW 

## Overview 

This project will analyze the student performance in general chemistry
in response to the implementation of two-stage quizzes and exams.

This repository follows the [TIER Documentation Protocol](https://www.projecttier.org/tier-protocol/specifications-3-0/#overview-of-the-documentation) ([GitHub repo](https://github.com/ProjectTIER/projecttier.org)), 
instructions for assembling a set of electronic files that document 
all the steps of data processing and analysis conducted for an
empirical research paper. 


## Hierarchy and description of files and folders

This repository has the following hierarchy of files and folders:

- This `README.md` file 
- Original Data and Metadata folder - `original-data`
    + Metadata folder - `metadata`
        - Metadata Guide - `metadata_guide.md`
        - Supplements - `supplements`
- Processing and Analysis  - `processing-and-analysis`
    + Importable Data - `importable-data`
    + Command Files - `command-files`
    + Analysis Data - `analysis-data`
- Eventually, an electronic copy of the complete final paper. 
	+ An `.Rmd` file with all the text and code to produce the final paper
	+ A knitted HTML or PDF file of the complete paper

Contents of these files and folders are described in the `README.md` 
files within these folders.

## README

The `README.md` file in the top hierarchy of this repository will contain
information about all the other files included in the documentation 
for the paper. In particular:

1. the statistical software or other computer programs that are 
needed to run the command files.
1. an explanation of the hierarchy of folders in which the 
documentation is stored, and brief description each of the files 
included in the documentation.
1. a precise description of any changes made to the original data files 
to create the corresponding versions saved in the `importable-data` 
folder.
1. explicit, step-by-step instructions for using the 
documentation to replicate the statistical results reported in the 
paper.
