1. **Bibliographic citation for the original data file.** _NA_ This file was created from data obtained under _IRB#????????_ from the UW registrar and the instructor for the courses analyzed herein, and then collated by student number which was subsequently redacted.
1. **Digital object identifier (DOI) for the data file.** _DOI TBD_
1. **The date on which the author first downloaded, or obtained in some other way, the original data files.** _NEED TO ADD THIS_
1. **A written explanation of how an interested reader can obtain a copy of the original data file.** _Archive location TBD_
1. **Whatever additional information an independent researcher would need to understand and use the data in the original data file.** The particular information required can vary a great deal depending on the nature of the original data file in question, and deciding what additional information to provide therefore requires thoughtful consideration and judgment.In many cases, the relevant information is similar to what is found in a codebook or users' guide for a dataset: variable names and definitions, coding schemes and units of measurement, and details of the sampling method and weight variables.In some cases, it is also necessary to include information about the file structure (e.g., the delimiters used to separate variables, or, in rectangular files without delimiters, the columns in which the variables are stored).Any other unique or idiosyncratic aspects of the data that an independent user of the data would need to understand should be explained as well.

    - `exam1predict`, `exam2predict`, `finalexampredict` (all numeric; _intended_ range 0 to 100): Score that students predicted they would earn on the exam. This was asked as the last question on the exam, and was worth three points.These points were added to the straight exam score, so a midterm for example was worth 103 points (100 for 20 multiple-choice questions worth 5 pts/ea. + this single free-response question worth 3 pts). The exact wording of the question changed over the years included in the study, but the intention was always that students would predict an integer score between 0% and 100%, even on the final exam, which was scored out of 150 points. (**2021-03-31: NEED TO CHECK HOW WE HANDLED NON-INTEGER DATA SUCH AS LETTERS, THE SPEED OF LIGHT, ETC. CHECK THE DUNNING-KRUGER WORK...**)
            - actual range `exam1predict`: 0 to 100
            - actual range `exam2predict`: 0 to 880
            - actual range `finalexampredict`: 0 to 300
    - `exam1`, `exam2`, `finalexam` (all numeric): Student scores on exams. 
            - `exam1` (20 5-pt MC + 1 3-pt FR; range 10 to 103; max possible 103): 142 Exam 1 coverage: quantum mechanics, Lewis structures, VSEPR. 
            - `exam2` (20 5-pt MC + 1 3-pt FR; range 0 to 103, max possible 103): 142 Exam 2 coverage: stoichiometry, aqueous-phase reaction classes, molarity, differential rate laws
            - `finalexam` (35**?????** equally-weighted MC + 1 3-pt FR; range 0 to 154.29, max possible 155 **CHECK THIS VALUE. DOES THIS DEPEND ON THE YEAR??**): 142 Final Exam coverage: all prior material + gas laws, integrated rate laws, reaction mechanisms, collision theory
    - `instructorgrade` (numeric; range -0.2 to 4.0): Grade assigned to student. **NOTE: The fact that this range starts at -0.2 makes me wonder what source Michael Mack used when he compiled these data. This looks like a case where the equation I used calculated a literal value of -0.2, but I would have converted this to a 0.0 before submitting to the registrar. I wonder what other minor deviations in the actual posted grades might exist in this dataset?**
    - `exam` (character): Name of exam for the purposes of the Bloom's and complexity item analysis. Values are "Exam1", "Exam2", "FinalExam" in 2016, 2017, and 2018. Values are "exam1", "exam2", and "finalexam" in 2019.

    - `stud_ans` (character): Answer that student chose for `item_num` on `exam`. Questions had up to five choices (only one correct answer). Values include: "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", and "Z". The "Z" responses were put in place during the creation of the item analysis data set in 2018. This was a catchall for any blanks or multi-marks on the Scantron form. **CHECk THIS!!!**
