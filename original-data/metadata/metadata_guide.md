1. **Whatever additional information an independent researcher would need to understand and use the data in the original data file.** The particular information required can vary a great deal depending on the nature of the original data file in question, and deciding what additional information to provide therefore requires thoughtful consideration and judgment.In many cases, the relevant information is similar to what is found in a codebook or users' guide for a dataset: variable names and definitions, coding schemes and units of measurement, and details of the sampling method and weight variables.In some cases, it is also necessary to include information about the file structure (e.g., the delimiters used to separate variables, or, in rectangular files without delimiters, the columns in which the variables are stored).Any other unique or idiosyncratic aspects of the data that an independent user of the data would need to understand should be explained as well.
